Euler notes:
The outcome used was death of the patient, when a date of death was present the patient was assumed to have died. No number (9999-999-999) was assumed to still be alive.
When analysing the data with euler, it can be noted that the accuracy of the models diminish, which is intresting as I previously thought they would increase (more data, better prediction). This could be becase the data set used in google collab (100'000 rows), was somehow "better data", where the models were able to have better accuracy. 
In euler more patient data is available, and most likley the model wasn't able to create/find good predictors for the model.
